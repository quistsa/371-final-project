                Tire rotations are an often-neglected aspect of regular car maintainance, but can be equally as vital as other, more "glorified" aspects.
                Your vehicle does not ride directly on the bottom of its tires, nor does it treat each tire the same as the others. This causes tires to wear
                unevenly across their width, as well as unevenly across individual tires. As tires are a more costly investment in order to keep your car moving,
                it is important to keep them as healthy as possible for as long as possible. Thus, tire rotations are necessary. All that needs to happen during a 
                tire rotation is that each tire is moved to another area of the car, distributing wear more evenly accross tires and increasing their longevity.

            <h3>How do I know when it's time to get new tires?</h3>

            <p>The easiest way to determine tire health is by examining each tire, paying special attention to the tread. Take a penny and stick it into the tread 
                (with Abraham Lincoln's head facing down). If the tread reaches Lincoln's head or above, there is still life left in the tires. If it comes very close
                 or does not reach his head, it may be time to replace the tire. Additionally, it is important to examine the tire as a whole to determine overall health.
                  any excessive cracking- particularly on the side of the tire- could also indicate the time being up for that particular tire. If you see any metal cords 
                  poking out or at all exposed, it is reccomended that you replace the tire before driving any more, as it could potentially be unsafe.
